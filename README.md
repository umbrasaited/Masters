This repository is created for a purpose of storing code related to Masters Thesis "Anticipated Customer Profile Design using Machine Learning for Banking Sector". 

The repository contains 3 folders:

1. [Initialization](https://github.com/umbrasaited/Masters/tree/main/Initialization)
2. Clustering
3. Classification

The code inside the folder Initialization is categorized into Corporate and Retail to separate the snippets of code used when working with different types of customers. It contains such parts of code that could be used separately or in combination to make one program:

1. Quantile transform on numerical features
2. Elaborate data read function to check for missing or incorrect values
3. Feature correlation analysis
4. Principal Component Analysis

The code inside the folder Clustering is categorized into Corporate and Retail to separate the snippets of code used when building models for different types of customers. It contains such clustering models:

1. K-means
2. Spectral Clustering
3. HDBSCAN
4. Birch

The code inside the folder Classification pertains to models built when classifying newly onboarded customers. Minor adjustments are required to change the type of customer features used. The folder contains such models:

1. XGBoost
2. TabNet




The work is completed by Dovilė Umbrasaitė.
